Understanding the factors that influence keeping a customer as a client in predicting churn is crucial for telecom companies to enhance their service quality and customer satisfaction. As the data scientist on this project, you aim to explore the intricate dynamics of customer behavior and demographics in the Indian telecom sector in predicting customer churn, utilizing two comprehensive datasets from four major telecom partners: Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone, and BSNL:\n","\n","- `telecom_demographics.csv` contains information related to Indian customer
